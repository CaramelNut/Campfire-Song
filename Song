In the middle of the ground. (In the middle of the ground)
The prettiest hole (The prettiest hole)

And the green grass grows all around, all around.

And on this tree, (And on this tree)
There was a branch. (There was a branch)
The prettiest branch (The prettiest branch)
That you ever did see. (That you ever did see)

And the hole in the ground.
And the green grass grows all around, all around.
